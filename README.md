# multi_chat

Computer Networks - Group project made with https://github.com/dardwo

Python code is for a chat client that connects to a chat server using TCP sockets. The client prompts the user for a name, connects to the server, and then listens for incoming messages in a separate thread. The user can enter a message to send to the server, which will be broadcasted to all connected clients.

C code creates a socket server which listens on a specific port and accepts incoming connections from clients. Once a client has connected, the server can send and receive data to and from the client.
